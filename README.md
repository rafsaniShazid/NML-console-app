### Input Format
1. Enter the number of equations (integer).
2. Enter the coefficients of each equation followed by the constant term.
3. Specify the desired precision for the iterative solution.

#### Example Input
```
Enter the number of equations: 3
Enter the coefficients of each equation followed by the constant term:
Equation 1: 10 -1 2 6
Equation 2: -1 11 -1 25
Equation 3: 2 -1 10 -11
Enter precision: 0.001
```

#### Sample Output
```
Step 1:
x[1] = 0.600000 x[2] = 2.272727 x[3] = -1.100000 
Step 2:
x[1] = 1.137273 x[2] = 2.009091 x[3] = -0.790909
